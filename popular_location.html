                    <p>Honda is known for loading the City with luxury features and many of competitors would match up to it. The new City is loaded with features like the sunroof, rear AC vents, reversing camera, father-touch climate control, and keyless entry and exit.
                        The controls and the gearshift are the smoothest which makes you driving in city conditions a pleasure with not much of an effort.</br>

                    <p>This is the "go to" car for families, chauffeured owners, hotels and cabbies. This 2nd-gen Innova has vastly improved over the earlier car and - in fact - also bridged the gap between MPVs & SUVs (especially that superb 2.8L AT variant). It's not uncommon to see luxury garages with an Innova parked between Audis & Mercedes', such is the appeal & utility offered by this car. </br>

                    <p>The Maruti Suzuki Dzire is one of India's best-selling cars and the subcompact sedan has beaten its sibling, the Alto, as India's best-selling car in the past. It's a car that holds strong goodwill in the market and the third-generation version added more premium appeal when it arrived in 2017 with a complete design overhaul. </br>
